/**
 * The Ledger: Skipper's tasks, in a panel at the right of its pane. It shows
 * only while Skipper's pane is the one pane on screen. Focus mode keeps it;
 * maximize hides it with the other chrome.
 *
 * Three sections, each shown when it has work. Working: an agent is on the
 * work now (a sent task whose pane works or ended its turn), in send order.
 * Open: the work is not closed and no agent is on it: the rows that need the
 * person first, then done tasks, then the rest. A row that needs the person
 * turns amber. Finished: the work Skipper closed on the person's word, newest
 * first, the last 100. A plan is a head row with its tasks always open under
 * it, and it counts as one item. Rows slide to their new place, flash on a
 * change and fade in; a close slides the work down into Finished.
 *
 * Ctrl+Shift+Right from Skipper's pane gives the keys to the panel, and opens
 * a folded one. Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down, or the plain arrows, step the lit row.
 * Enter does the row's click. Ctrl+Shift+Left or Esc gives the keys back to
 * Skipper's pane. The lit row stays across redraws.
 *
 * A click on a row does the main action for its state: open the pane or the
 * result. Small icons at the right edge do the rest, only when they apply:
 * the pane or the result. The panel never writes: only Skipper changes rows.
 * No row has a menu. The rows come read-only from the backend, again on each
 * change to `ledger.db`.
 *
 * An open workspace (#154) filters the rows by their project: its projects'
 * work, and work with no project. A plan shows by its own project or a visible
 * task, with only visible tasks under it. All work, in the head, shows every row.
 * The filter is a view: no row changes.
 *
 * Project Skippers (#project-skippers): the panel also shows beside a
 * project Skipper's pane. Its head filter shows all projects or one: the
 * Skipper's panel opens on all, a project Skipper's on its project. A
 * hand-off nests under its plan with its project's letters in place of the
 * dot, and its tasks nest one more step. A project Skipper's own rows show
 * the letters too.
 *
 * The person can fold the panel to a rail: a chevron, and the amber count of
 * the tasks that need them. The fold stays in localStorage on this machine.
 * A fold or an unfold slides the width; a saved fold at start does not.
