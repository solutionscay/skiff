///
/// - Raise it when a request, reply or event the app uses changes shape or
///   meaning, or when the app needs a new request and has no fallback.
/// - Do not raise it to add a request, a reply, an event or an optional
///   (`#[serde(default)]`) field. An older daemon answers an unknown request
///   with an error, and both sides skip a message they cannot read.
/// - Do not raise it to remove a request the app no longer sends.
