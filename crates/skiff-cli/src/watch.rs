//! `skiff watch`: follows the panes of the open tasks in the Skiff agent's
//! ledger, for that agent. The app starts it with the agent's session and it
//! stops when that session ends. A pane that waits notifies the person. A
//! pane that goes idle after work or after a prompt, exits or is gone wakes
//! the agent: one line typed into its input box while it is idle and the box
//! is empty. The daemon types it only if the person typed nothing since that
//! check. An idle pane with a pending task wakes the agent once per idle
//! stretch, and the line names the oldest pending uid and the `skiff ledger
//! send` command for it. A task whose pane
//! restarted since the send (a restore runs a new shell under the old id)
//! wakes the agent once as interrupted. Plans have no pane and are not
//! followed, but a plan holds the idle lines of its tasks' panes: a pane
//! whose open tasks are all `sent` in one plan wakes the agent only when
//! every task in that plan ended, in one line for the plan (see [`ended`]).
//! Its other lines (exited, restarted, gone, pending) go at once. At its start, a run counts the done tasks not yet reported and,
//! if there are any, tells the agent once, in a line of its own. Each step
//! sets done the open tasks whose panes are gone (see
//! [`ledger::close_gone`]), and a task closed that way after the start wakes
//! the agent once, whichever command closed it.
//!
//! It keeps no state of its own. The ledger, the session list and each pane's
//! unread flag are the input, so a new run rebuilds the same view. One lock
//! file per daemon socket keeps it to one copy. When a build or an update
//! puts a new `skiff` at its path, the watcher runs the new one in its place.
//!
//! Best effort: the list, the ledger read and the submit are separate reads,
//! and the state events can lag. Held pending lines are checked against a
//! new ledger read just before the submit, and a line whose task left pending
//! is dropped. A row that changes after that read is not seen.
