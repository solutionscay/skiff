//! The Skiff agent (Skipper): one agent session that coordinates the others.
//! The app and the `skiff skipper` command share this code, so they set up
//! the same folder and find the same session.
//!
//! The daemon marks the session as the coordinator and finds or starts it in
//! one guarded request ([`Client::coordinator`]). Nothing here guesses it from
//! the folder.
//!
//! The template and the `skiff-cli` skill are built in. The skill is copied
//! out next to `projects.toml`, and the folder links to that copy, so the
//! skill updates with Skiff.
//!
//! This module is the public compatibility facade; its implementation lives in child modules.
